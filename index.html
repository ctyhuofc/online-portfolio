<h1>Chris Yates</h1>
<p>I was born on February 19 and went to Queen Elizabeth highschool in Edmonton Alberta. I haven't worked on any projects and I am currently working at TELUS as a Business Analyst. I only speak English fluently, but I know a <span style="font-weight: bold";>tiny</span> amount of French, Japanese, and Danish. I enjoy listening to music and watching movies.</p>

Since I have no projects and have attended no courses, I'll instead create an unordered list other companies I have worked for:
<ul>
    <li><form action="./images/Dell.JPG" target="_blank">Dell - <button>Click me for picture</button></form></li><br>
    <li><form action="./images/pizza73.png" target="_blank">Pizza73 - <button>Click me for picture</button></form></li><br>
    <li><form action="./images/steepedmonkey.jpg" target="blank">Steeped Monkey Brains - <button>Click me for picture</button></form></li>
    </ul>

And an ordered list of the languages I "speak" in order of proficiency:

<ol>
    <li>English</li>
    <li>French</li>
    <li>Danish</li>
    <li>Japanese</li>
</ol>
